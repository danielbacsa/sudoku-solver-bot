## Setup
Currently this is setup for the sudoku (solo) game from SGT Puzzles Collection. To tune it for your game you just have to replace the reference pictures that PyAutoGUI uses to find the board and the numbers. I only used the PyAutoGUI built-in image recognition features in this script. If you resize the game window you might have to update your reference images.
